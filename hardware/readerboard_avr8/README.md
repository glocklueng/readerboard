readerboard_avr8
================

Replacement controller hardware for interfacing with Data Display Corporation
LED readerboards based on Hitachi 6309 controllers.

Status
======

This board has not yet been fabricated or tested. It is based on other stable
designs, and a prototype using an Arduino Leonardo.

Bill of Materials
=================

See readerboard_avr8_bom.csv. I have not built this board from the BOM yet, so
expect errors, and be sure to re-check against the respective datasheets.

Requirements
============

* [EAGLE 5.11 Freeware, Light, Hobbyist, Standard, or Professional]
  (http://www.cadsoftusa.com/shop/pricing/)
